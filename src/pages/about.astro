			CALE is more than just a conferenceâ€”it's an arena for change, leadership, and advocacy. Our vision is to
			unite student leaders across 17 member schools in Ontario, amplifying their voices and propelling progress
			in engineering. Through a diverse range of events, including workshops, career fairs, general meetings, and
			speaker series, CALE provides a platform for students to experience firsthand the power of leadership in
			sparking positive change.

		<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold leading-relaxed">Theme "Make it happen, Make it matter"</h2>
		<p class="leading-relaxed">
			Our theme encapsulates the essence of CALE. "Make it happen" represents the influence and leadership that
			student leaders can exhibit, while "Make it matter" emphasizes the significance of values and the
			far-reaching impact of our actions within our community. Together, we aim to inspire delegates to take
			charge of their own universities, advocate for community betterment, and make a meaningful difference.
